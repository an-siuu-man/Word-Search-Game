# WORD SEARCH GAME

## What it is
It is a fun little game which generates a grid of letters with hidden words inside it. The words can be taken from a specific topic provided by the user, and the user can also set the size of the grid.

## What's unique about this
It lets the user provide a text input for their topic choice, which means there are a HUUUUGE number of possible topics which the user can choose from. Also, the words generated in the same topic differ from each time, thus making the word list for each game very unique.

## What does it use
It is built using Python and Django, which is a Python web framework. It lets us render dynamic HTML.
